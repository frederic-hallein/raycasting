# Ray Casting

Raycasting is a rendering technique used to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map. This code uses the DDA (= Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm. 
The implementation is based on the following website: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html. The rendering is done using the SDL2 library. For a
proper install of SDL2 on Linux, I refer to https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/linux/index.php. 


# How to run (Linux)

Step 1: Download all the files. \
Step 2: Open a terminal and go inside the `/raycasting` directory. \
Step 3: By running the `make all` command, it creates a `main.exe` executable.  \
Step 4: Run the executable by typing: `./main`. 

# How to play

Character control is done using the WASD keys. \
W : forward \
S : backwards \
A : camera rotates left \
D : camera rotates right
