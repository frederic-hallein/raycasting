# Raycasting

Raycasting is a rendering technique used to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map. This code uses the DDA (= Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm. 
The rendering is done using the SDL2 library.

sudo apt install libsdl2-image-dev
```

3. Clone the remote repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/frederic-hallein/raycasting
```
4. To compile the project, go inside the `raycasting/` directory and run the following command: 
```bash
make all
``` 
$~~~~~~~~$ This should create a `main` executable file in the same directory. 

5. Run the executable by using the following command: 
```bash
./main
```

Character control is done using the `wasd` keys. 
- `w` : forward movement
- `a` : backward movement
