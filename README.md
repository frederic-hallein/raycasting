# Raycasting

Raycasting is a rendering technique used to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map. This code uses the DDA (= Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm. 
The implementation is based on the following website: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html. The rendering is done using the SDL2 library.
