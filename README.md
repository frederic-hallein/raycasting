# ray_casting

Implementation of raycasting via the DDA algorithm. Code is based on this website: \
https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html. The rendering is done with the SDL library. 


# How to run

Step 1: Download all the files. \
Step 2: Via a terminal go to the raycasting directory. \
Step 3: Enter the "mingw32-make -f makefile" command. This should create a main.exe in the same folder. \
Step 4: Run main.exe. 

# How to play

Character control is done with the WASD keys. 

# Troubleshooting

If the command from Step 3 is not recognized, try to install the mingw-get-setup from the website: \
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) and install the mingw32-make package in the MinGW Installation Manager. \
After that, make sure you have "mingw32\bin" in your PATH.
